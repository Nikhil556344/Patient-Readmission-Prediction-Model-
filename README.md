# Patient-Readmission-Prediction-Model-
This project aims to predict 30-day patient readmissions post-discharge using machine learning techniques. By identifying high-risk patients, healthcare providers can proactively allocate resources, design interventions, and improve overall patient outcomes.

**Key Features**

Data Preprocessing:

Handled missing values and encoded categorical variables for improved model performance.
Engineered features such as prior hospital visits, average length of stay, and comorbidities.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Visualized trends and correlations between patient attributes (e.g., age, gender, and discharge type) and readmission rates.
Identified patterns in readmissions across different patient demographics.

**Machine Learning Models:**

Implemented logistic regression and random forest models.
Evaluated models using accuracy, F1-score, and ROC-AUC metrics.

**Visualization:**

Designed interactive dashboards using Power BI to provide stakeholders with actionable insights.

**Technologies Used**

Programming: Python (pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn)
Database Management: SQL
Visualization: Power BI
Environment: Jupyter Notebook, Power BI Desktop
